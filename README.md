# Datasets

### Please feel free to use any publicly available dataset. A common Machine Learning practice is to separate the dataset into training, validation and test sets. You can drop the validation set doing k-fold validation by using training data in k-folds etc.

## Hint: Take 20% of the data as test set. Don't look at it, till you are ready to test your solution. Demo to the judges by showing that your solution works on the test set data, or making up new test examples yourselves.
